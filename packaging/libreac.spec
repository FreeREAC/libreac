%description
libreac speaks Roland REAC, the protocol between Roland digital consoles and their
stageboxes, so a Linux machine can sit on a REAC network as an equal: hear a
stagebox, enrol it, and read what it is straight from its own frames — its inputs
and outputs, its model, its firmware.

libreac is the REAC protocol library: it recognises a REAC frame (EtherType 0x8819),
reads its sequence counter, detects the sample rate, and decodes and encodes the
24-bit braided audio region in both directions — the 40-channel master broadcast
and the box's upstream return — plus a legacy plain-LE diagnostic path. It also
implements the REAC control plane: control-block layout and checksums, head-amp
records, box identity, and the master/slave establishment state machines, and it
reads frames from a live AF_PACKET capture or an offline pcap.

%description -n libreac-transport
libreac-transport is the REAC transport layer: AF_PACKET frame RX/TX over a lock-free
ring, a SCHED_FIFO cadence pacer with clock discipline, network interface and VLAN
scanning, segment locking, and slave/master establishment orchestration built on
libreac's protocol state machines. The public API carries no socket type, so an
alternate backend can implement the same shape; the library holds no Linux capability
itself, that belongs to the process that links it.

# Every src/*.c, never a hand-kept list. The list form had drifted twice: it was

# the shared object shipped without reac_ports_parse, reac_headamp_base and the
# whole reac_ctrl_*/reac_headamp_* control-block surface, while the -devel package
# happily installed headers declaring them. Nothing failed at build time -- a
# consumer only found out at link.

# --no-undefined IS THE GATE FOR THE PARAGRAPH ABOVE. The glob fixed the drift it

%changelog
* Thu Oct 08 2026 Pau Aliagas <linuxnow@gmail.com> - 1.7.1-1
- libreac and libreac-transport are now installed from the FreeMixer package
  channel: signed RPMs for Fedora 44 (x86_64, aarch64) and DEBs for Debian
  bookworm and trixie (amd64, arm64). Add the channel once, then install or
  update with dnf or apt. The libraries themselves do not change.
- The Debian packages are libreac6, libreac-dev, libreac-transport7 and
  libreac-transport-dev, named after the sonames they carry. The Fedora
  packages keep their names: libreac, libreac-devel, libreac-transport and
  libreac-transport-devel.

* Wed Oct 07 2026 Pau Aliagas <linuxnow@gmail.com> - 1.7.0-1
- A connected stagebox is described only by what it says on the wire: its
  inputs and outputs from its declaration, its family from its identity page,
  and its name from both (S-1608, S-4000S-3208, S-4000S-1624, S-4000S-4000
  ...). A box whose family has never been captured is named by its widths
  (REAC-0816).
- The built-in model table is now a model catalogue, used only to emulate a
  box and to plan a show offline. It never sizes or names a connected box;
  when the two disagree the box wins and the difference can be reported.
- The S-0808's name, which arrives split across two frames, is now read.
- A box that joins after the console first asked for its identity is asked
  again, once a second, so its firmware and hardware block are no longer left
  empty.
- A stagebox in master mode is recognised from what it announces or the width
  it broadcasts. A 40-channel master that has not announced itself yet is
  waited on instead of being taken for a desk.
- Developers: reac_box_facts.h is new; the catalogue functions are renamed
  (reac_box_catalogue*), reac_box_master_model is gone, and discovery reports
  declared widths. libreac's soname is 6 and libreac-transport's is 7.

* Fri Sep 25 2026 Pau Aliagas <linuxnow@gmail.com> - 1.6.0-1
- A stagebox may declare any even width from 2 to 40 channels in each
  direction, and a 40-channel box is legal. A box that returns 40 channels
  upstream is a box, not a desk.
- A sender that broadcasts is given a bounded time to show whether it is the
  desk or a stagebox, and is treated as a box once that time passes without a
  desk-only message.
- Sample-rate detection measures one stream, so a 48 kHz session heard in both
  directions is no longer read as 96 kHz.
- An identity reply is accepted only when both of its checksums close, and the
  plain-LE diagnostic decode refuses a geometry wider than the frame.
- Developers: reac_cfg.h is the one declaration of the configuration
  vocabulary and reac_code.h the one list of refusal codes. This is a
  source-level change; libreac's soname moves 4 to 5 and libreac-transport's 5
  to 6.

* Tue Sep 22 2026 Pau Aliagas <linuxnow@gmail.com> - 1.5.0-1
- A VLAN trunk names its VLANs by tagging, and the topology tap hears them: a
  VLAN whose stagebox is still cold is discovered as soon as the switch tags
  any frame on it, without transmitting anything.
- Developers: reac_topo_heard_vids() and REAC_TOPO_TAGGED_OTHER are added. No
  existing symbol changes.

* Tue Sep 22 2026 Pau Aliagas <linuxnow@gmail.com> - 1.4.0-1
- The decisions about whether a wire is vacant and when to stop waiting for
  the topology tap are made by the library, through reac_knock.h and
  reac_tapwait.h, instead of by each program that links it. Behaviour is
  unchanged.

* Mon Sep 21 2026 Pau Aliagas <linuxnow@gmail.com> - 1.3.2-1
- A capture no longer hears frames from every network interface on the machine
  for the instant before it is bound to its own. A cold cable could previously
  show a stagebox that was mastering another interface as heard on it.
- The transmit socket is bound to its interface and ignores incoming traffic,
  instead of queueing every REAC frame on the host.

* Fri Sep 11 2026 Pau Aliagas <linuxnow@gmail.com> - 1.0.0-1
- The protocol library as proven on real Roland desks and stageboxes at 44.1,
  48 and 96 kHz.
